# Terraform AWS EKS Infrastructure

This project demonstrates how to create and manage a robust, scalable AWS infrastructure using **Terraform**, adhering to industry standards and best practices. The setup includes an **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** cluster, complete with supporting resources like VPCs, subnets, and NAT gateways.

---

## Project Architecture

### Key Components:
- **VPC**: Custom Virtual Private Cloud with public and private subnets.
- **EKS Cluster**: Managed Kubernetes cluster with two Node Groups for high availability.
- **NAT Gateways**: Secure routing for private subnets.
- **Elastic IPs**: Static IPs for NAT Gateways.
- **Route Tables**: Public and private route tables for subnet routing.
- **Internet Gateway**: For outbound internet access from public subnets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- An AWS account

### Steps to Deploy:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/singhshivam0898/Terraform-EKS.git
   
2. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init

3. Review the execution plan:
   ```bash
   terraform plan --var-files="./config/terraform.tfvars"

4. Apply the Terraform configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform apply --var-files="./config/terraform.tfvars"

5. Confirm the infrastructure is successfully created.

## Features
Fully Modular Design: Each resource is modularized for reusability.
Scalable Infrastructure: EKS clusters with multiple Node Groups for scalability.
Secure Networking: Includes private subnets and NAT Gateways.
Cost Optimization: Public and private subnets strategically routed.

---

### Terraform Best Practices Used
Parameterized variables for flexibility.
Separation of configuration into modules.
Outputs for visibility into key resource values.

---

### Outputs
After applying the Terraform configuration, the following outputs will be displayed:

- EKS Cluster Name
- Public and Private Subnet IDs
- NAT Gateway IDs
- Node Group Details

---
